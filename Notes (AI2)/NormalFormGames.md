# Game Theory
## Games Theory
Games are often played with actions performed **Simultaneously** or **Turn-Based**. Games will also often include a set of players, strategies, outcomes, the game rules and the payoffs of certain actions.
...

**Game Theory** explores how people interact with each other to an adapting environment, with separate or shared goal, and various actions that change the environment. These behaviours by the players, most especially the strategies employed when performing actions, can best be seen in playing games.

There are two standard representation of game theory:
* **Normal Form**, or matrix/strategic form, where players move simultaneously.
* **Extensive Form**, where players more sequentially/one after another.

## Normal Form Games
In NFGs, players will often try to achieve a certain strategy that benefits them the most. Which will result in the player obtaining the:
* **Better Response Strategy**. Which is a strategy that produces the more favourable outcome for a player than any other strategy, taking other players' strategies as given. ...
* **Better Response Strategy**. Which is a strategy that produces best outcome for a player than any other strategy, taking other players' strategies as given. ...

A strategy $s_1$ **Dominates** another strategy $s_2$, if by playing $s_1$ the agent receives a better payoff than if it played $s_2$; regardless of what the other players do. Given this, rational agents will not play dominated strategies. The **Dominant** strategy is the strategy that gives the better payoff compared to playing any other strategies; where there are no assumptions to be made on what the other players will play, and thus provide the strongest solution. Granted, the dominant strategy may not exist.
