# 2D Transformations

## 2D Transforms
**Scaling**, multiplying each component/coordinate by a scalar value. **Uniform Scaling**, where all components are multiplied by the same scalar value. **Non-Uniform Scaling**, where components are multiplied by different scalar values.

## 2D Matrix Transforms
There are five different transformations that can be represented by $p' = Mp$, these are:
* **Scale**, where ...
* **Stretch**, where ...
* **Flip**, where ...
* **Shear/Skew**, where ...
* **Rotate**, where ...

**Translate** is another transformation, but it is requires a vector addition as opposed to multiplication. It is given by ...

**Homogeneous Coordinates** are ...

**Affine Transformations** use homogeneous coordinates to perform transformations on larger matrice. It can stil do all six degrees of transformations, as stated previously. For example:
...
