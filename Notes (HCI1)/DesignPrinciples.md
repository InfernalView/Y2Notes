# Design Principles

## Principles and Interaction
**Principles** provide a general guidance in any user interface design, these are generally more abstract than rules, and are harder to evaluate. ...

People normally undergo **Seven Stages of Actions**, in achieving their goal:
* It starts with a **Goal**, an objective they wish to achieve in the world.
* Executing a task
    * They then **Plan** what actions they need to interact with the world in a way to achieve the goal.
    * Then they **Specify** the actions it will perform.
    * And finally **Perform** or execute these actions on the world.
* Evaluating the result
    * They then **Perceive** what happens to the world after performing their task.
    * And **Interpret** what their perception means.
    * The finally they **Compare** the result from the world to their expectations in their goal.

## Design Principles
There are five **Design Principles** that can guide developing a suitable user interface:
* **Visibility**
* **Affordances**
* **Signifiers**
* **Constraints**
* **Feedback**

**Visibility** emphasises how users obtain information of the world based on what they see. Knowledge can be captured via the world, observations of the world and its various states; and knowledge in the head, which are information that the users already know and can be applied using actions to the world. Most situations will have users rely on knowledge in the world, with knowledge in the head reinforcing cultural conventions. Obviously with time, people will gradually lean towards using more knowledge in the head; but again, in most cases, it is easier to recognise information from the world, than recall information already present in the head. ...

**Affordances** describe the relationship between the properties of an object, and the capabilities of the user, which suggests how an object is to be used. They provide clues as to how to manipulate objects. They are not the properties themselves, because an object can only afford an action, if the user it capable of using the object. ...

**Signifiers** are indicators/signals that conveys the appropriate behaviour to use. ...

**Constraints** ...

**Feedback** ...
