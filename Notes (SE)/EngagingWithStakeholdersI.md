# Engaging with Stakeholders I

## Human/User-Centered Design
Is an **Iterative Design Process** that focuses on **Users** and their **Needs** in each phase of the design process. With projects that are explicitly based on the whole user experience, with full understanding of the users, tasks and environments.

There are three phases in using HCD process:
* **Inspiration**, observing and understanding the every-day problems that people deal with.
* **Ideation**, generating ideas from the inspiration that have been gathered.
* **Implementation**, produce protoypes that will be actively used by the people.

## Who
**Stakeholders** is a person/group/company that are directly or indirectly involved in a project,with individual interests, that may affect or be affected by the project. There are three types:
* **Primary**, directly involved with the project.
* **Secondary**, indirectly involved with the project.
* **Tertiary**, indirectly affected, or not immediated impacted.

## When
Stakeholders may have varying goals at different times during the design process of the project lifecycle, so there are differing ways to engage with stakeholders throughout the process:
* **Initiation**, by identifying key stakeholders and understanding their needs/expectations.
* **Planning**, by making a stakeholder engagement plan and gather the requirements.
* **Execution**, by ensuring ongoing communication with stakeholders and address any emerging issues.
* **Closure**, by reviewing stakeholder engagment outcomes and gather final feedback.
* **Monitoring and Controlling**, by tracking stakeholder satisfcation and make necessary adjustments.

## Why
It is important to suitably identify stakeholders that best support the project and provide suitable feedback on the project. The following provide techniques on identifying stakeholders:
* **Brainstorming**, considering all possible individuals, groups and organisations that would be affected by, or have an interest in the project.
* **Stakeholder Mapping**, making a visual representation of all stakeholders, and categorise them by interest and power.
* **Interviews/Observations**, by talking to individuals on coalating feedback pertaining to interests and concerns about the project.
* **Consulations with Experts**, by engaging with experts that specialise in the area of the project, and leverage knowledge on other possible and less obvious stakeholders.
* **Documentation Review**, re-reviewing the project plans, business deals and user requirements, to support in the process of identifying stakeholders.

## Stakeholder Analysis
There are further ways to help identify stakeholders, as well as deciding what level of engagement is required and or sufficient for certain kinds of stakeholders. This is best analysed through the use of a **Stakeholder Matrix/Power-Interest Grid**. Which visualy describe what stakeholders how more **Power**, and more **Interest** in the project; and thus help in prioritizing these groups of individuals to engage the most with.

Additionally there is a **RACI Matrix** which defines the roles and responsibilities of the stakeholders in the project, and clarify how much involvement they have on the project. It defines who is:
* **Responsible**, in completeing the tasks of the project.
* **Accountable**, in making decisions and taking ownership.
* **Consulted**, in providing input and feedback.
* **Informed**, in who needs to be kept updated regarding the project.
