# Project Management and Planning

## Project Management
**Project Management** is required to ensure that a project is: delivered to the customer **On Time**, within a certain **Budget**, the product **Meets** the customer's **Expectations**, and that a **Well-Functioning** development team is maintained through this process.

There a couple of **Universal Management Activities** that enables this, which are:
* **Project Planning**, in which project managers are responsible for planning, estimating, scheduling project development, and assigning people to tasks.
* **Risk Management**, in which project managers asses the risks that may affect a project, and monitor these risks, and take actions when problems arise.
* **People Management**, in which project managers must choose people for their teams and establish working methods that lead to effective team performance.
* **Proposal Writing**, which is the first stage in a software project, and requires writing a proposal to win a contract. Within it must describe the objectives of the project and how it will be carried out.
